				<h1> X11 on iOS </h1>
				<hr>
				<h3> Introduction </h3>
				<p>
					I'm excited to announce the "developer edition" <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup> of X11 on iOS. I've successfully compiled and packaged the required dependencies (and some optional packages) for a fully functioning X11 desktop system on iOS 12 and up. All packages (and all their dependencies, as there are very few *nix libraries ported to iOS) have been compiled for arm64 and have been tested on iOS 12.4 and iOS 13.2.
				</p>

				<h3> How it works </h3>
				<p>
					At the moment, a virtual screen is accessed via a VNC client to an Xvnc<sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup> instance running on the iDevice. If you're unfamiliar, Xvnc is an X server with a virtual screen that can be accessed via VNC. The best part of this is no drivers are required: input and output are handled by Xvnc.
				</p>
				<p>
		
				</p>
				<h3> Why </h3>
				<p>
					 I want to turn my iPad into a proper C development environment, and a windowing system helps with that. It's a powerful machine with a lot of Unix features, so X11 seemed reasonable. I'd like to eventually run Wayland, but at the moment that seems years off. Being able to compile and run arbitrary Linux applications would be huge -- Firefox, GNOME,  Java GUIs: it's all possible in X11<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup>.
				</p>
				<p>
					 I intend for this project to largely be documentation for building yourself, so in case I disappear and my repo becomes outdated or goes down you can build it yourself.
				</p>
				
				<h3> Current Features </h3>
				<ul>
					<li> X11 on iOS via Xvnc </li>
					<li> Working window manager (jwm) </li>
					<li> Loads of other packaged libraries, tools, and applications </li>
					<li> All available in a <a href="https://maxleiter.com/cydia">Cydia repo</a></li>
				</ul>
				<h3> What's next? </h3>
				<ul>
					<li> OpenGL support via Mesa </li>
					<li> The rest of Xorg applications </li>
					<li> Proper desktop enviroments like XFCE and GNOME</li>
				</ul>
				<h3> Want to help? </h3>
